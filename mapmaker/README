UPDATE (15 Oct 2012):

I made the first update to the code in a year yesterday (a minor fix to a popup panel). Anyways, I'm intending
to start working on this again soon, since I _think_ I found an affordable host.

Anyways, assuming this pans out, I'm going to switch the backend from MySQL to MongoDB and implement login
functionality. I'm switching to Mongo bacause a) It's cooler, b) it's under active development, c) it's not an
Oracle product (I deal with that crap enough in my day job).

Welcome to the Mapmaker README. I bet you're here looking for the installation information.

However, this being the year 2011, I put it in the wiki, not the README. The wiki can be accessed at this URL:
