                        <h3>Where am I? Feature</h3>
                        <p>Clicking on the map will create a marker showing what imported features are associated with
                            the coordinates that were clicked on.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Selecting Map Features</h3>
                        <p>Users can select a map and associated features via the "Features" Stack Panel. Note that
                            borders must be imported from the Census Department before they can be displayed. Also,
                            features must be imported from the USGS before they can be displayed on the map.
                        </p>

                        <p>The user must select which type of border they wish to view, then the state (and possibly
                            county,
                            depending on the
                            border type). If not selecting to view a state or county, the user must select a specific
                            item
                            they wish to view
                            from the Specific Item box.
                        </p>

                        <p>Next, the user has the option of selecting which type of USGS feature they wish to display
                            within
                            the borders they
                            have selected. This is not mandatory. Currently, only one feature type at a time can be
                            displayed. These features
                            will be displayed as a Google Maps Marker, which can be clicked on for further information.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Export Functions</h3>

                        <p>Export functions are not currently implemented.</p>

                        <h3>Managing Borders, Features, and Administration</h3>

                        <p>To import or delete a border, click the Manage Borders button in the Admin tab of the
                            application stack panel. It is HIGHLY recommended that you import State and County features
                            before importing features based on them.
                        </p>

                        <p>To import USGS features for a location, click the Manage Features, then select the state
                            to display the features for. Currently, all USGS feature types for the state will be
                            imported.
                        </p>

                        <p>To select the year of the TIGER/Line data used for displaying borders, or changing the date
                            of the USGS data set, click the App Settings button. Changing either of these items will
                            dump all data related to it (i.e. changing from 2010 to 2009 will dump all imported borders
                            that
                            were created from the 2010 data). Also, the USGS dataset is updated about every 2-3 months,
                            and archives are not kept. To get the current version, visit
                            http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm
                            and look for the last updated date.
